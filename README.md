Train Booking CLI — C++ (OOP + CSV persistence)

A small, menu-driven console app that simulates a train ticket system with two roles:

Operator: add/delete routes

User: register, log in, search routes, book tickets

Data is stored in simple CSV files alongside the executable.

Features

User Account Management

Email & password registration (basic regex validation)

Password Vigenère encryption with a per-password random key (demo-only)

Login with encrypted verification

Routes & Tickets

Add/Delete routes (Operator)

Validate date (DD/MM/YYYY, must be in the future; leap years handled)

Validate city names (letters/spaces/hyphens)

Search routes & book tickets (User)

CSV Persistence (auto-created with headers on app start)

operators.csv — email,password,encryption_key

users.csv — email,password,encryption_key

routes.csv — departure,destination,date

tickets.csv — user,departure,destination,date,class,hour

⚠️ On startup, the program truncates all CSVs and seeds two operators:
operator1@mail.com / password1 and operator2@mail.com / password2.

OOP Design

Classes

AccountManager: password key generation, Vigenère encryption, login/registration helpers, password strength check.

TrainRoute: route data & validators (date/city), add/delete helpers.

Operator: multiple inheritance from AccountManager + TrainRoute; role-specific menus.

User: multiple inheritance from AccountManager + TrainRoute; user flows (register/login/search/book).

Concepts Used

Encapsulation of auth & validation logic.

Multiple inheritance for code reuse.

Abstraction of common operations.
